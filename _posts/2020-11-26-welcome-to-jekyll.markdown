I figured I should get my voice and thoughts out eventually. There's many things I like to share or blog about. I thought about it before, but haven't gotten around to it. I figured I'll get to it now. Some things about database optimizing, open source, mental health, parkour, my journey in tech, etc. I definitely thought about starting a blog back when I started parkour as well back when blogs were hotter in the scene, but I had a bit of imposter syndrome being new so I never ever really voiced my opinions on anything except in my own personal journal, but everyone's voice matters at the end of the day ðŸ™‚.

I didn't want to go the whole Medium route or Wordpress since I wanted to own what I write myself.

Well, first thing I got to do off the list:

1. Make the site prettier
2. Gather up some old presentations and notes I had
3. Have more meaningful conversations, meet wholesome people, create meaningful connections, live interesting experiences
4. Blog more
