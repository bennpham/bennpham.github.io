Hello all. I haven't posted in a while, but happy late New Years. I've been busy most of the end of December 2020 wrapping some last things before I went into holiday mode and transition to my new job. A lot happened during 2020 in my life and my old job. 2021 begins a new chapter into this transition period. Regardless, I'm in better health than how most of 2020 went to start things off and had a long New Years bike ride. COVID isn't around the world isn't getting better, but that's not something I can control. There's definitely were a handful of things I wanted to get done before 2020 end or a bit extra entering 2021 and I did got a few, but I definitely would like to post a few more things once I get around to it.

I might touch upon a reflection/look back at 2020 in a later post, but I was not in the best mental state then although I've met some good people in my life through some zoom training from mutual friends I've met before overseas from parkour trips. Things did turn around later towards the end of 2020 for my own life.

Regardless, some of my TODO lists and things I've been busy trying to get through

Looking through my TODO lists for the end of the year, I suppose I got through all of my work related and personal list and getting my health in a better state was a definite must do. I'm surprise I got through my **movies/show/anime** list, but I happened to just binge watch all of Cobra Kai in one go just because I was super tired from cycling and training on New Years and spent Saturday as a complete rest/leisure day. I did train a bit with a friend before that, but I surely took a lot of naps. My **blog & coding** section went on hold for a bit since I needed to prioritize my health first.

Next on my list would definitely be to finish up video editing so I can clear up some hard drive space and it does give a good look back on the year. Of course I definitely want to finish that Arma 3 1-KM mission challenge. Especially since we just had 17 players on the server today and what I was working on was a dynamic 19 players mission. That'd give more things to play with and there's some new modules I used that I'd like to see in action 😏.

The coding and the parkour zine articles will come after that, but for sure the video edits and game edits next. Overall, I feel good about my TODO lists. It feels a bit clearer now that I have more of a clairvoyant view on things writing about it. Definitely feels good now that I'm in a better state of mind too. As for the gaming section... everytime I read finish a game part, I always tell myself good luck with that... I don't finish singleplayer games as well as I do as when I was younger.

How do everyone else feels about their TODO lists. The things they got TODO and the things they've done? Maybe it's nicer to have a birds eye view of things so things don't feel so endless so you can actually say to yourself, "Oh, I actually have accomplished a lot".
