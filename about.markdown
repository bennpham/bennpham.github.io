# Hey there, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

Professionally, I'm a Fullstack Web developer. What do I like to do right now? Train some Muay Thai and share that with my friends, keep up with my nutrition and physical condition, eat good food, and see nice sights.

I originally started this blog to share my knowledge on things I've learned, interesting things that comes around, and other endeavors. Overall this blog will contain various things I've learned, interesting things that came around, my life updates here and there, etc.

As of 2024, majority of the blog will probably be about my Muay Thai adventures (although some of those take a while to write), random tech or gaming things that's not work related, or some updates here and there. Generally, I'd probably like to do some random video study analysis and throw that on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bennpham95) instead for Muay Thai related things whenever I get around to that.

If you want me to do any website/webapp designs, mock ups, or development, have a visit on [my portfolio site](https://bennpham.gitlab.io/#contact) and drop a message there.
