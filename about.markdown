# Hey there, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ruby on Rails Fullstack Developer at Quimbee working on e-learning webapps to help law students with their bar exams.

I was a Ruby on Rails developer back in Formulafolios where I build applications that help advisors manage their clients money and I was previously a PHP developer at Home Campus where I build applications that help coaches, student athletes, and athletic directors onboard and track game sessions during each sporting leagues before that.

I'm also a contributor to [IF-ME](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme), an open source mental health communication web app that helps people share their experiences with loved ones.

I decided to start this blog to share my knowledge on things I've learned, interesting things that comes around, and other endeavors. I'm big on the idea that we learned something from somewhere or someone and the best thing we can do is to contribute to that giant pool of collective knowledge and make the world a bit better than it was one small step at a time.
