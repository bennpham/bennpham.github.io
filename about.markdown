# Hey there, I'm Ben 👋

I'm a Fullstack Developer with various experience working on athletic schools scheduling softwares on PHP Laravel, FinTech with Laravel and Ruby on Rails, and e-learning webapps to help law students with their bar exams. I have experience on both front end and back end work.

I've been a contributor to [IF-ME](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme), an open source mental health communication web app that helps people share their experiences with loved ones.

The biggest hobby surrounding my life right now outside of tech things has been Muay Thai 🥊🦵 which also lead me to an interest in nutrition and cooking 👨‍🍳.

I decided to start this blog to share my knowledge on things I've learned, interesting things that comes around, and other endeavors. I'm big on the idea that we learned something from somewhere or someone and the best thing we can do is to contribute to that giant pool of collective knowledge and make the world a bit better than it was one small step at a time.

If you want me to do any website/webapp designs, mock ups, or development, feel free to contact my email.
